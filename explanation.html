					<h2>Why I chose Stars in a Jar: </h2>
					<p> I wanted to create a relatively easy to follow tutorial on how to make
						origami stars. I was first introduced to this by my friend who gave me 
						a paper star, and I thought it was wonderful. This is why I am now creating
						a tutorial that teaches anyone how to make a paper star.</p>
						
					<h2>My Above and Beyond: </h2>
					<p> I added an image in the background that gets repeated on the y and x axis of 
						the webpage. I also added transparency to a few of the dive boxes on each page. 
						I had fun changing the bullet shape to something that was not already built 
						in HTML/CSS.</p>
						
					<h2>How I could Improve: </h2>
					<p> I could have spent more time on color scheme. I should of planned out different 
						design layouts and tested different colors together; that way I could have more 
						options and an easier time on coding the look of the website. I also could have done
						something more with the links during responsive design. I would have liked to 
						make them into buttons or something.</p>
