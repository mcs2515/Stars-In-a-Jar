				<p> Why make Stars in a Jar? It is an easy, low-budget "Do It Yourself" project.
					Stars in a Jar makes a wonderful gift for friends and family. It is a
					memorable gift anyone would cherish; even for adults and children alike. </p>

						<h2> Materials: </h2>
						<h4> Paper Strips</h4>
						<p> You can buy some from a local art or online store. You can also make your 
							own by cutting long thin paper strips from mostly anything made of paper.<p>
						<h4> Scissors</h4>
						<p> A common household item needed to cut strips of paper.</p>
						<h4>Jar and Cork</h4>
						<p> Where the "stars" will be placed in and the cork used to seal them in.</p>
					</div>
					
					<br>
					
					<div id= "optionalList">
						<h2> Optional Materials: </h2>					
						<h4> Glue</h4>
						<p> Used on cork to make sure the jar is completely sealed.</p>
						<h4> Glitter</h4>
						<p> Add inside the jar along with the stars to create a bit more magic 
							and fun to the project.</p>
						<h4> Small Ribbon</h4>
						<p> A colorful and nicely designed ribbon tied to the neck of the jar 
							can make the end product a wonderful gift.</p>
						<h4> Tweezers</h4>
						<p> It is a definite help when trying to re-arrange the 
							stars in the bottle. Often times the jar is too small for you to use your 
							fingers.</p>

					<h3 id= "num1"> ~Step 1~</h3>
					<img id= "img1" src= "media/step1.jpg" alt="image1" width="146" height="147" />
					<div id="step1"><p> Take your paper strip and start at one end. 
									Fold the end over to a side to create a loop.</p></div>
					
					<h3 id= "num2"> ~Step 2~</h3>				
					<img id= "img2" src= "media/step2.jpg" alt="image2" width="146" height="147" />
					<p id="step2"> Start to bring that end through the loop you created.</p>
				
					<h3 id= "num3"> ~Step 3~</h3>
					<img id= "img3" src= "media/step3.jpg" alt="image3" width="146" height="147" />
					<p id="step3"> Pull the end all the way through the loop until you create 
									a snug knot.</p>
					
					<h3 id= "num4"> ~Step 4~</h3>
					<img id= "img4" src= "media/step4.jpg" alt="image4" width="146" height="147" />
					<p id="step4"> Flatten the knot so it dosn't get undone. If the end sticks 
									out a bit after creating the knot, fold the extra end piece on itself. </p>
									
					<h3 id= "num5"> ~Step 5~</h3>
					<img id= "img5" src= "media/step5.jpg" alt="image5" width="146" height="147" />
					<p id="step5"> Now take the other end of the strip paper or "tail" and fold it over one of the 
									edges of the now pentagon shaped knot.</p>
									
					<h3 id= "num6"> ~Step 6~</h3>
					<img id= "img6" src= "media/step6.jpg" alt="image6" width="146" height="147" />
					<p id="step6"> Continue to fold the tail over the five different edges. This
									should be relatively easy as you fold over one edge, it guides
									the tail to the edge where it should fold over next.</p>
				
					<h3 id= "num7"> ~Step 7~</h3>
					<img id= "img7" src= "media/step7.jpg" alt="image7" width="146" height="147" />
					<p id="step7"> You are now reaching the last bit of the tail. You cannot fold 
									over any more edges, but you still have the tail hanging and the
									"star" can get undone. There is a way to fix this!</p>
				
					<h3 id= "num8"> ~Step 8~</h3>
					<img id= "img8" src= "media/step8.jpg" alt="image8" width="146" height="147" />
					<p id="step8"> Find the closest edge and tuck that end tail piece right into it.
									Now your "star" can not get undone!</p>
				
					<h3 id= "num9"> ~Step 9~</h3>
					<img id= "img9" src= "media/step9.jpg" alt="image9" width="146" height="147" />
					<p id="step9"> This is what you should get when you are done folding the strip	
									of paper. You should get a pentagon. You are almost done!</p>
				
					<h3 id= "num10"> ~Step 10~</h3>
					<img id= "img10" src= "media/step10.jpg" alt="image10" width="146" height="147" />
					<p id="step10"> Hold the pentagon between two fingers and pinch at each of the points
									with another set of fingers. You will want to do this gently.
									As you finish pinching each point, the star should take volume and shape. </p>
				
					<h3 id= "num11"> ~Step 11~</h3>
					<img id= "img11" src= "media/step11.jpg" alt="image11" width="146" height="147" />
					<p id="step11"> You have now created a star! Keep making more until you fill a whole
									jars worth! </p>
